A vocabulary of 50,000 is a standard practice that captures over 99% of word occurrences in a large corpus while filtering out rare words and potential typos, which would be difficult to train meaningful vectors for.\n",

Training on the full dataset would be computationally prohibitive for this project.\n",

The progress log shows the average loss consistently decreasing (from an initial ~9.6 to ~6.7), which confirms that the model was successfully learning.
